This [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org) extension allows you to perform color palette analysis using Quickmarble's [Censor](https://github.com/Quickmarble/censor) palette analyzer directly within Aseprite.

## Latest Changes
censor-analysis binary is now bundled with the extension!

## Requirements
This extension has been tested on Mac OS (specifically Mac OS Sequoia 15.6)

Windows testing to follow...Linux eventually

It is intended to run on Aseprite version 1.3.7 or later and requires API version 28 (as long as you have the latest version of Aseprite, you should be fine!)

## Permissions
When you run this plugin for the first time, you'll be aked to grant some permissions.

When prompted, select the "Give full trust to this script" checkbox and then click "Give Script Full Access" (you'll only need to do this once).
